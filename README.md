# Alefy - Web Page

This is a web page developed during my enrollment on Code With Mosh's Ultimate HTML5 & CSS3 Course. At the end of the extensive course, we had to develop with the assistance of Mosh, a static web site that integrated the basic fundamentals of html and css, while also adding animations, transitions and other structural and styling elements with the help of Photoshop and Bootstrap to make the page more elegant. Also, some JavaScript was used to make the site interactive.
